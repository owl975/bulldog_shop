# Project 3 Feedback

## Project Strengths

* The site looks great and has a logical user flow.
* I'm impressed with your shopping cart implementation -- it shows strong problem-solving skills!
* The try-on feature sets the app apart from most other shopping sites :)
* Nice use of partials and Rails helpers throughout.

## Areas of Improvement

* See code comments marked with `CJ`
* Add an `admin` column (type boolean) on the users table, and make it so that only admins can add a new product, update a product, or delete a product.
* Push yourself to connect with a payment API -- even though you won't be shipping actual products, it would be nice to have payments ready to go for anyone who wanted to clone and use the shop.
* Next time you're working on a project focus on more frequent commit messages. You should have at least 20-30 for a project like this.
* Fill out your `README` to include a little about the project, what technologies you used, and the steps to run the project locally.
